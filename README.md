%                  File Name: Single-Trial EEG classification

**main file**: main_EEG_Classification.m (work for old version on Matlab (2015 or 2016))
**main file**: 'main_EEG_Classification_2019.m' is working fine on Matlab 2019.

"main_EEG_Classification_2019.m" includes the following steps

1) Load data for BCI Competition-IV dataset 2A- Subject A01: Training and Testing Data 
2) Band-pass filtering the data in two different frequency bands: [8-12] Hz and [14-30] Hz (i.e. mu and beta band respectively)
3) Use training band-pass filtered data to compute the CSP projected matrix and use it to project the data into surrogate space. 
4) Compute the log variance feature for each trial in 3-6s section.
5) Train a classifier.

6) Repeat same steps (1-4) of feature extraction and classify each trials. 

Good Luck!
